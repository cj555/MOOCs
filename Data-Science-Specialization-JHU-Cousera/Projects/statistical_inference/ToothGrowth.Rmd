### About the data

In this project, we analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. The data is the length of odontoblasts (teeth) in each of 10 guinea pigs at each of three dose levels of Vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg) with each of two delivery methods (orange juice or ascorbic acid).


### Basic inferential data analysis
We load the data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hold',cache=TRUE}
# print("Chuck 1")

library(datasets)
data(ToothGrowth)
# ?ToothGrowth
str(ToothGrowth)

```

We encode dose as a factor and summarize the data. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hold',cache=TRUE}
# print("Chuck 2")

# factorising dose 
ToothGrowth$dose <- factor(ToothGrowth$dose)

# summarize the data
summary(ToothGrowth)
with(ToothGrowth, table(dose,supp))

# NA data
print("number of NAs"); sum(is.na(ToothGrowth))

```

The tooth length is between `4.2~33.90` with a mean `18.81` overall. There is no `NA` data and `10` observations with each dose level and delivery method. 

Now boxplot the tooth lengths vs dosage and delivery methods respectively. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hold',cache=TRUE}
# print("Chuck 3")
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(len ~ dose, data = ToothGrowth, main="(a) Dose",xlab="mg", ylab="length(mm)")
boxplot(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth, main="(b) Supp")
# print("Chuck 4")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
boxplot(len ~ dose*supp, data = ToothGrowth,ylab="length(mm)", main="Dose & Supp")


```

As shown in `Dose`, generally, the tooth length increase as the rise of Vc dose regardless of Supp. And there seems no significant improvement on tooth length when performing different delivery methods (Figure `Supp`). In latter section, we choose to use T-test on these on assumptions due to the small sample size. At first glance of figure `Dose & Supp`, orange Juice seems to perform better at the lower dosages, but has a similar result to Vitamin C at the 2.0mg dosage. 

### Hypotheses

We will examine 3 Null Hypotheses in this sections:

1. Different level of Vc dosage have the same effect on tooth length.
2. Orange Juice (OJ) and Vitamin C (VC) have the same effect on tooth length.
3. OJ and VC have the same effect on tooth length when the dosage is the same. 


#### Hypothesis 1: Different level of Vc dosage have the same effect on tooth length.

Here we group the data by three levels of dosage and perform T-test between each pair of dosage(0.5~1. 1~2, 0.5~2). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hold',cache=TRUE}
# print("Chuck 4")
with(ToothGrowth, pairwise.t.test(len,dose, pool.sd=FALSE))

```

As we can see, the p-value in each pair is much more smaller than 0.05, which indicates that we could reject the Null Hypotheses in 95% confidence interval. In other words, levels of Vc dosage do have significant effect on tooth length in 95% confidence interval.

#### Hypothesis 2: Orange Juice (OJ) and Vitamin C (VC) have the same effect on tooth length.

Now, let's perform the t-test to the second hypothsis. Here, we group the data by two deliveray methods. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hold',cache=TRUE}
# print("Chuck 5")
with(ToothGrowth, t.test(len~supp))

```

The result shows that 95% confidence interval `( -0.1710156, 7.5710156)` contains zero, which suggest that we are not able to reject the Null Hypothesis. Or say that Orange Juice (OJ) and Vitamin C (VC) do have the same effect on tooth length with in 95% confidence interval. 

#### Hypothesis 3: OJ and VC have the same effect on tooth length when the dosage is the same. 

Hypothesis 3 contains three sub hypotheses, which is OJ and VC have the same effect on tooth length regarding three levels of dosage. Here we check three sub hypotheses using 95% confidence interval. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hold',cache=TRUE}
# print("Chuck 6")
levels <- levels(ToothGrowth$dose);levels

# t-test regarding dose grouped by supp

re <- lapply(1:length(levels), function(i) 
    with(ToothGrowth,
         t.test(len[dose==levels[[i]]]~supp[dose==levels[[i]]])
         )
    )

lapply(1:3, function(i) re[[i]]$conf.int)

```
As the result shows that we would reject the Null hypothese at `"0.5"` and `"1.0"` dosage levels but fail to reject the Null hypothesis at `"2.0"` levels. The T-tests confirm our initial impression that orange Juice seems to perform better at the lower dosages, but has a similar result to Vitamin C at the 2.0mg dosage.


### Conclusions

In summary, in 95% confidence interval, different level of Vc dosage have effect on tooth length. And in general orange Juice (OJ) and Vitamin C (VC) have the same effect on tooth length. Finally, at `"0.5"` and `"1.0"` dosage levels, OJ and VC show different effects on tooth but simliar effect at `"2.0"`


### Code Chucks

```{r, echo=TRUE,results='hold',cache=TRUE}
print("Chuck 1")
library(datasets)
data(ToothGrowth)
?ToothGrowth
str(ToothGrowth)

```



```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hold',cache=TRUE}
print("Chuck 2")

# factorising dose 
ToothGrowth$dose <- factor(ToothGrowth$dose)

# summarize the data
summary(ToothGrowth)
with(ToothGrowth, table(dose,supp))

# NA data
print("number of NAs"); sum(is.na(ToothGrowth))

```


```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hold',cache=TRUE}

print("Chuck 3")
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(len ~ dose, data = ToothGrowth, main="(a) Dose",xlab="mg", ylab="length(mm)")
boxplot(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth, main="(b) Supp")

print("Chuck 4")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
boxplot(len ~ dose*supp, data = ToothGrowth,ylab="length(mm)")

```



```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hold',cache=TRUE}

print("Chuck 4")
with(ToothGrowth, pairwise.t.test(len,dose, pool.sd=FALSE))

```


```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hold',cache=TRUE}

print("Chuck 5")
with(ToothGrowth, t.test(len~supp))

```



```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hold',cache=TRUE}

print("Chuck 6")
levels <- levels(ToothGrowth$dose);levels

# t-test regarding dose grouped by supp

re <- lapply(1:length(levels), function(i) 
    with(ToothGrowth,
         t.test(len[dose==levels[[i]]]~supp[dose==levels[[i]]])
         )
    )

lapply(1:3, function(i) re[[i]]$conf.int)

```
